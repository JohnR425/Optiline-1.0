TEAM MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS:
Harsha Mahajan: Developed the frontend, including creating all elements and styling. Also helped come up with test cases to improve consistency of our program’s responses and wrote the majority of the README file.
John Ryu: Helped design the frontend interface structure and worked on refining prompts for consistency. Additionally, contributed to the README file, spearheaded presentations and recorded demo videos. Managed git version control and helped establish a steady workflow that fits with our agile methodology.
Akash Mungra: Worked on backend and integrated it with the frontend by implementing a web socket. Created functions to format and send data back and forth between the server-side code implementing the API calls and the frontend output. Streamlined backend code to efficiently organize different API calls based on preferences by restructuring code logic. Added more to the test cases to make it more robust, such as verifying that creating code documentation doesn’t actually change any of the input code. Contributing to making prompts more specific so that they can more consistently meet user needs, allowing the code to consistently pass test cases.
Aryan Puttur: Worked on backend and prompt engineering. Implemented cookies in order to save the user’s preferences even if they close the browser. Contributed to prompt engineering to increase reliability of our code’s output for its various functions. Added supplementary documentation to our code.
Omprakash Sahoo: Worked on debugging and created test cases, used vitest library to make unit tests for the runCompletion function, and tested all the different cases of preferences that could be used to ensure the responses are valid. Contributed to testing our prompts and providing feedback on how to improve prompts.
